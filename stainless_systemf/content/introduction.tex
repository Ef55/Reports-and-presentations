Lambda calculi constitute the theoretical underpinnings of
functional programming, a paradigm which became more and more popular over the last decades. 
This makes studying lambda calculi of interest, as the properties which can be proven about them more or less translate into properties of languages built on top of them.
Moreover, in order to model more advanced features of programming languages, one can complexify the simply typed lambda calculus (STLC). System F is an example of such an extension which introduces parametric polymorphism \cite{Cardelli1985OnUT}, a feature that many programming languages support nowadays.

In this project we first proved key properties of STLC, and afterwards extended the work already done to prove them for System F as well.
