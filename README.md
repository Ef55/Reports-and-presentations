# Presentations and reports
Some (hopefully) interesting reports and presentations I worked on.
Also serves as a place for me to centralize some of my LaTeX code. 

## PDFs
Pre-built PDFs are available in the `build` sub-directory of each presentation/report.

## Build
All projects should build with
```shell
latexmk -shell-escape <main-file>.pdf
```
